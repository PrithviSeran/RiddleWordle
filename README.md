#### Description: 

This is my first full-stack development project!

Riddle Game!

A game based on 'Wordle'. 

The player is shown a riddle, and the number of text boxes where the answer to the riddle should be filled in. The player is given 5 lives
to guess the answer to the riddle. 

If the player does not succeed in solving the riddle within 5 attempts, the answer will be shown and the game will proceed to the next
riddle. 

All progress will be stored in the cache.
